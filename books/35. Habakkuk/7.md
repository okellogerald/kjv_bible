1. Now the sons of Issachar were, Tola, and Puah, Jashub, and
Shimrom, four.

1. Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down
from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and
the glory of the LORD filled the house.

1. Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia,
Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,

1. Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the
doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,

1. So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

1. Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not
his days also like the days of an hireling?

1. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them
that persecute me, and deliver me:

1. My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

1. A good name is
better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of
one’s birth.

1. How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the
joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a
cunning workman.

1. And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the
son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war
against it, but could not prevail against it.

1. The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

1. Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

1. In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and
told the sum of the matters.

1. When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was
discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood;
and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.

1. Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;
and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.

1. Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,
as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my
soul desired the firstripe fruit.

2. And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai,
and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father’s house, to wit, of
Tola: they were valiant men of might in their generations; whose
number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six
hundred.

2. And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’s house.

2. The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

2. That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared
God above many.

2. And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be
granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even
to the half of the kingdom.

2. As a servant
earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the
reward of his work:

2. Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
there is none to deliver.

2. Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine
eye.

2. It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will
lay it to his heart.

2. Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy
belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

2. And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate
with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as
the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.

2. Stand in
the gate of the LORD’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say,
Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these
gates to worship the LORD.

2. Also, thou
son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end,
the end is come upon the four corners of the land.

2. Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.

2. And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their
wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are
before my face.

2. And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the
grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee:
by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

2. The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none
upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man
his brother with a net.

3. And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah; Michael,
and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them chief men.

3. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with
their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and
praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
ever.

3. The son
of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

3. And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the
doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against
his house.

3. Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in
thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me
at my petition, and my people at my request:

3. So am I made to possess months of vanity, and
wearisome nights are appointed to me.

3. O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
hands;

3. Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
heart.

3. Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
countenance the heart is made better.

3. Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

3. Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou,
and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool
in the highway of the fuller’s field;

3. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways
and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.

3. Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense
upon thee all thine abominations.

3. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
another.

3. They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
with their lies.

3. The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

3. That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he
uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

4. And with them, by their generations, after the house of their
fathers, were bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty thousand men:
for they had many wives and sons.

4. Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
LORD.

4. The son of
Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

4. Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein,
and the houses were not builded.

4. For we are sold, I
and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we
had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue,
although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage.

4. When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.

4. If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea,
I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

4. Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy
kinswoman:

4. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
of fools is in the house of mirth.

4. Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in
Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of
Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

4. And say unto him, Take heed,
and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of
these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,
and of the son of Remaliah.

4. Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The
temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.

4. And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I
will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in
the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

4. The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till
the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth,
and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to
it.

4. They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be
leavened.

4. Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD
called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat
up a part.

4. The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a
thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now
shall be their perplexity.

5. And their brethren among all the families of Issachar were valiant
men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies fourscore and seven
thousand.

5. And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all
the people dedicated the house of God.

5. The son of Abishua,
the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief
priest:

5. And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and
the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.
And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the
first, and found written therein,

5. Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen,
Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?

5. My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
broken, and become loathsome.

5. Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread
down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.

5. That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from
the stranger which flattereth with her words.

5. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
hear the song of fools.

5. Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head
like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

5. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil
counsel against thee, saying,

5. For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye
throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;

5. Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.

5. And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it
between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour
much flesh.

5. In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles
of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

5. Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall
Jacob arise? for he is small.

5. Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep
the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

6. The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.

6. And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to
praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David
praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before
them, and all Israel stood.

6. This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe
in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the
king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD
his God upon him.

6. These are the children of the
province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been
carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried
away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his
city;

6. And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

6. My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without
hope.

6. Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage
of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast
commanded.

6. For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

6. For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of
the fool: this also is vanity.

6. How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

6. Let us go up against Judah, and vex
it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the
midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:

6. If ye
oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not
innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your
hurt:

6. An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it
is come.

6. After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four
heads; and dominion was given to it.

6. For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie
in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth
as a flaming fire.

6. The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord
GOD.

6. For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a
man’s enemies are the men of his own house.

7. And the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and Jerimoth,
and Iri, five; heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of
valour; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand
and thirty and four.

7. Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before
the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the
fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had
made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat
offerings, and the fat.

7. And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the
Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.

7. Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah,
Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum,
Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was
this;

7. And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went
into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his
life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined
against him by the king.

7. O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.

7. So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for
their sakes therefore return thou on high.

7. And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a
young man void of understanding,

7. Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
heart.

7. This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters
of grapes.

7. Thus saith the Lord GOD, It
shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.

7. Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land
that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

7. The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:
the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding
again of the mountains.

7. After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with
the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were
before it; and it had ten horns.

7. They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all
their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.

7. Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by
a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

7. Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my
salvation: my God will hear me.

8. And the sons of Becher; Zemira, and Joash, and Eliezer, and
Elioenai, and Omri, and Jerimoth, and Abiah, and Anathoth, and
Alameth. All these are the sons of Becher.

8. Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of
Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

8. And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
seventh year of the king.

8. The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and
two.

8. Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of
the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther
was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the
house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s
face.

8. The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes
are upon me, and I am not.

8. The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my
righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.

8. Passing through the street near
her corner; and he went the way to her house,

8. Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the
patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

8. I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the
boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,
and the smell of thy nose like apples;

8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken,
that it be not a people.

8. Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.

8. Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine
anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will
recompense thee for all thine abominations.

8. I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the
eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

8. Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake
not turned.

8. And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A
plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the
midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:

8. Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise;
when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.

9. And the number of them, after their genealogy by their
generations, heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of
valour, was twenty thousand and two hundred.

9. And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept
the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.

9. For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem,
according to the good hand of his God upon him.

9. The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

9. And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for
Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of
Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.

9. As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down
to the grave shall come up no more.

9. Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish
the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.

9. In the twilight, in
the evening, in the black and dark night:

9. Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
bosom of fools.

9. And the roof of thy mouth
like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing
the lips of those that are asleep to speak.

9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
established.

9. Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and
burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;

9. And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are
in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that
smiteth.

9. I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days
did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head
like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his
wheels as burning fire.

9. Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea,
gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.

9. And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of
Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of
Jeroboam with the sword.

9. I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned
against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he
will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his
righteousness.

10. The sons also of Jediael; Bilhan: and the sons of Bilhan; Jeush,
and Benjamin, and Ehud, and Chenaanah, and Zethan, and Tharshish, and
Ahishahar.

10. And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the
goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to
Israel his people.

10. For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and
to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

10. The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.

10. So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.

10. He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
know him any more.

10. My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

10. And, behold, there met
him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.

10. Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better
than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.

10. I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.

10. Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

10. And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my
name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?

10. Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

10. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.

10. And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not
return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

10. Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the
house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.

10. Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover
her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall
behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.

11. All these the sons of Jediael, by the heads of their fathers,
mighty men of valour, were seventeen thousand and two hundred
soldiers, fit to go out for war and battle.

11. Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s
house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of
the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.

11. Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the
commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.

11. The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab,
two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen.

11. Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

11. God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every
day.

11. (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

11. Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to
them that see the sun.

11. Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in
the villages.

11. Ask thee a
sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height
above.

11. Is
this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in
your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.

11. Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall
remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall
there be wailing for them.

11. I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body
destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

11. Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
Egypt, they go to Assyria.

11. For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel
shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

11. In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the
decree be far removed.

12. Shuppim also, and Huppim, the children of Ir, and Hushim, the
sons of Aher.

12. And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I
have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an
house of sacrifice.

12. Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the
law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.

12. The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.

12. Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

12. If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and
made it ready.

12. Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every
corner.)

12. For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have
it.

12. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud
forth: there will I give thee my loves.

12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

12. But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my
name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my
people Israel.

12. The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude
thereof.

12. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
