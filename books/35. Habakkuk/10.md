upon the earth.

doctrine of vanities.

answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat
the yoke that thy father did put upon us?

together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on
the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street
of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the
great rain.

9. And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the
sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;

9. Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and

say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s
loins.

10. And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass
of Israel.

10. And their brethren, Shebaniah,
Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,

10. Hast thou not poured me out
as milk, and curdled me like cheese?

10. He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
his strong ones.

shall fall.

their two furrows.

11. And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had
done to Saul,

11. For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more
to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
you with scorpions.

11. Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers,
and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the
land, and from the strange wives.

skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.

11. He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
face; he will never see it.

heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from
under these heavens.

11. When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not
as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed
it; they turned not as they went.

11. And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand
the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am
I now sent.

And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.

11. And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread
out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make
Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.

12. They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the
body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,
and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.

12. Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
As thou hast said, so must we do.

12. Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

12. Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
preserved my spirit.

12. Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.

12. Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

12. The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a
fool will swallow up himself.

12. Wherefore it shall come to pass, that
when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on
Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

12. He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his
discretion.

12. And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the
wheels that they four had.

12. Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself
before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.

12. Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your
fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain
righteousness upon you.

13. So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against
the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and
also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire
of it;

13. And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
the counsel of the old men,

13. But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or
two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.

13. Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.

13. And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this
is with thee.

13. Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
heart, Thou wilt not require it.

13. In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but
a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.

13. The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the
end of his talk is mischievous madness.

13. For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by
my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the
people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the
inhabitants like a valiant man:

13. When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out
of his treasures.

13. As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
wheel.

13. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help
me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

13. Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the
multitude of thy mighty men.

14. And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and
turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

14. And answered them after the advice
of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will
add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
you with scorpions.

14. Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed
times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof,
until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.

14. The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani,

14. If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from
mine iniquity.

14. Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou
art the helper of the fatherless.

14. Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near
destruction.

14. A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

14. And my hand hath found as a nest
the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left,
have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing,
or opened the mouth, or peeped.

14. Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is
confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and
there is no breath in them.

14. And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the
face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

14. Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.

14. Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day
of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.

15. So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of
God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand
of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

15. Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the
Levite helped them.

15. Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

15. If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine
affliction;

15. Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his
wickedness till thou find none.

15. The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the
poor is their poverty.

15. The labour of
the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to
go to the city.

15. Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or
shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the
rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the
staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.

15. They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their
visitation they shall perish.

15. And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
that I saw by the river of Chebar.

15. And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward
the ground, and I became dumb.

15. So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in
a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

16. And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to
your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all
Israel went to their tents.

16. And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers,
and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the
first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.

16. Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

16. For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:
and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

16. The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out
of his land.

16. The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
wicked to sin.

16. Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
eat in the morning!

16. Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat
ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the
burning of a fire.

16. The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of
all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of
hosts is his name.

16. And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the
same wheels also turned not from beside them.

16. And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that
stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon
me, and I have retained no strength.

17. But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

17. And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
wives by the first day of the first month.

17. Ater,
Hizkijah, Azzur,

17. Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

17. LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

17. He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
refuseth reproof erreth.

17. Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is
the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength,
and not for drunkenness!

17. And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in
one day;

17. Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the
fortress.

17. When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature
was in them.

17. For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?
for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither
is there breath left in me.

18. Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king
Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to
Jerusalem.

18. And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak,
and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.

18. Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,

18. Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

18. To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
earth may no more oppress.

18. He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
slander, is a fool.

18. By much slothfulness the building
decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth
through.

18. And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his
fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
standard-bearer fainteth.

18. For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the
inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that
they may find it so.

18. Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
the house, and stood over the cherubims.

18. Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of
a man, and he strengthened me,

19. And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

19. And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives;
and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.

19. Hariph, Anathoth,
Nebai,

19. I should
have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from
the womb to the grave.

19. In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
refraineth his lips is wise.

19. A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
answereth all things.

19. And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
child may write them.

19. Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly
this is a grief, and I must bear it.

19. And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the
earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside
them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s
house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

19. And said, O man greatly beloved,
fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he
had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak;
for thou hast strengthened me.

20. And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

20. Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

20. Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
take comfort a little,

20. The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the
wicked is little worth.

20. Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice,
and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

20. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more
again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the
Holy One of Israel, in truth.

20. My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my
children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to
stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

20. This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.

20. Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone
forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

21. And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
and Jehiel, and Uzziah.

21. Meshezabeel, Zadok,
Jaddua,

21. Before I go whence I shall not return,
even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;

21. The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
wisdom.

21. The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
mighty God.

21. For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the
LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be
scattered.

21. Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

21. But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but
Michael your prince.

22. And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,
Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

22. Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

22. A land of
darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any
order, and where the light is as darkness.

22. The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
sorrow with it.

22. For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow
with righteousness.

22. Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion
out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a
den of dragons.

22. And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went
every one straight forward.

23. Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same
is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

23. Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,

23. It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
understanding hath wisdom.

23. For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
determined, in the midst of all the land.

23. O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not
in man that walketh to direct his steps.

24. Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and
Telem, and Uri.

24. Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,

24. The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
of the righteous shall be granted.

24. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee
with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner
of Egypt.

24. O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest
thou bring me to nothing.

25. Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah,
and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.

25. Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

25. As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
righteous is an everlasting foundation.

25. For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
and mine anger in their destruction.

25. Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon
the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob,
and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation
desolate.

26. And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and
Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

26. And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

26. As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
sluggard to them that send him.

26. And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according
to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was
upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.

27. And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

27. Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

27. The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the
wicked shall be shortened.

27. And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be
taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and
the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.

28. Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and
Athlai.

28. And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated
themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their
wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge,
and having understanding;

28. The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation
of the wicked shall perish.

28. He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath
laid up his carriages:

29. And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub,
and Sheal, and Ramoth.

29. They clave to their brethren, their
nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s
law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and
do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and
his statutes;

29. The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction
shall be to the workers of iniquity.

29. They are gone over the passage: they have
taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is
fled.

30. And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah,
Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

30. And that we would not give our daughters unto the
people of the land, not take their daughters for our sons:

30. The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
inhabit the earth.

30. Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

31. And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah,
Shimeon,

31. And
if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath
day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on
the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the
exaction of every debt.

31. The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
tongue shall be cut out.

31. Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves
to flee.

32. Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

32. Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with
the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;

32. The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth
of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

32. As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand
against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33. Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

33. For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for
the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for
the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to
make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our
God.

33. Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the
haughty shall be humbled.

34. Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

34. And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God,
after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to
burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:

34. And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and
Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

35. Benaiah,
Bedeiah, Chelluh,

35. And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits
of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD:

36. Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

36. Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks,
to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in
the house of our God:

37. Mattaniah,
Mattenai, and Jaasau,

37. And that we should bring the firstfruits
of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees,
of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of
our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same
Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.

38. And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,

38. And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when
the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of
the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the
treasure house.

39. And
Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

39. For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring
the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the
chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that
minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake
the house of our God.

40. Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,

41. Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,

42. Shallum, Amariah, and
Joseph.

43. Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau,
and Joel, Benaiah.

44. All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by
whom they had children.
