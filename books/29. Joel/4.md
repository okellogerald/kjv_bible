unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one
law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall

called to come in unto the king these thirty days.

have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted

dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable
flesh into my mouth.

and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off
his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under
it, and the fowls from his branches:

of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the
records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful

unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned

15. I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
second child that shall stand up in his stead.

walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this
side the river.

servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the
spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers
were behind all the house of Judah.

16. Go,
gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye
for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and
my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king,

before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.

16. Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,
that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his
garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their
voice against the cities of Judah.

16. The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not
the elders.

16. Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the
staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and
with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with
astonishment:

will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.

17. This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by

evil.

27. For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;
yet will I not make a full end.

27. Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing
mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.

28. Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his
charge.

28. Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do
not deceive me?

28. And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,

28. For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;
because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent,
neither will I turn back from it.

28. All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

29. And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.

29. Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and
take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man,
salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay
my staff upon the face of the child.

29. And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,

29. The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:
every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

29. At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
kingdom of Babylon.

30. And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

30. And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy
soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.

30. And at Bethuel, and at
Hormah, and at Ziklag,

30. And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments
of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt
thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek
thy life.

30. The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have
built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for
the honour of my majesty?

31. For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in
all nations round about.

31. And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore
he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not
awaked.

31. And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and
at Bethbirei, and at Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign
of David.

31. For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the
anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of
the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her
hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of
murderers.

31. While the word was in the king’s
mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar,
to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

32. And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
thousand and five.

32. And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
dead, and laid upon his bed.

32. And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and
Ashan, five cities:

32. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as
oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the
most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he
will.

33. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

33. He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
prayed unto the LORD.

33. And all their villages that were round about
the same cities, unto Baal. These were their habitations, and their
genealogy.

33. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he
was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet
with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’
feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.

34. And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

34. And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands:
and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed
warm.

34. And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah, the son of Amaziah,

34. And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed
the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever,
whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from
generation to generation:

35. Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times,
and the child opened his eyes.

35. And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of
Asiel,

35. And all the inhabitants of the earth
are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army
of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay
his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

36. And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy
son.

36. And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah,
and Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,

36. At the same time my
reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour
and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords
sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent
majesty was added unto me.

37. Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
ground, and took up her son, and went out.

37. And Ziza the son of Shiphi,
the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of
Shemaiah;

37. Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those
that walk in pride he is able to abase.

38. And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he
said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for
the sons of the prophets.

38. These mentioned by their names were princes in their
families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly.

39. And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and
shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.

39. And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east side
of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

40. So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou
man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.

40. And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide, and
quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of old.

41. But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no
harm in the pot.

41. And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of
Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found
there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their
rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.

42. And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears
of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that
they may eat.

42. And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men,
went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah,
and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

43. And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred
men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus
saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.

43. And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, and
dwelt there unto this day.

44. So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
according to the word of the LORD.
